        <!-- Section 1: ARPANET -->
        <section class="content">
            <h2>2.1 ARPANET</h2>
            <h3>Who</h3>
            <p>ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was developed by the U.S. Department of Defense and is considered the precursor to the modern internet.</p>

            <h3>What</h3>
            <p>ARPANET was the first packet-switching network, allowing computers at different research institutions to communicate. This network laid the foundation for the internet.</p>

            <h3>Why</h3>
            <p>Its primary goal was to create a communication system that could survive disruptions and ensure resilience in case of an attack.</p>

            <h3>When</h3>
            <p>Established in 1969, the first successful message was sent between UCLA and Stanford. By 1983, ARPANET transitioned to using TCP/IP protocols, marking the official start of the modern internet.</p>

            <h3>How</h3>
            <p>ARPANET’s key innovations included packet-switching and the development of TCP/IP protocols. Read more on the <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/internet/history-internet/arpanet" target="_blank">Internet Society’s History Page</a>.</p>

        <section class="content">
            <h2>2.2 Vint Cerf & Bob Kahn</h2>
            <h3>Who</h3>
            <p>Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, known as the "fathers of the internet," co-authored TCP/IP, which became the foundation of internet communication.</p>

            <h3>What</h3>
            <p>Their development of TCP/IP allowed different networks to communicate seamlessly, forming the backbone of the internet.</p>

            <h3>Why</h3>
            <p>TCP/IP protocols were essential for enabling reliable data transmission across independent networks.</p>

            <h3>When</h3>
            <p>They published their paper on TCP/IP in 1974. By 1983, TCP/IP became the standard for ARPANET, establishing the modern internet.</p>

            <h3>How</h3>
            <p>Cerf and Kahn’s work on open-architecture networking allowed networks to interconnect globally. Learn more about Vint Cerf on the <a href="https://research.google/people/author32412/?&type=google" target="_blank">Google Research Page</a>.</p>

            <div class="example">
                <h4>Example:</h4>
                <p>For their contributions, Cerf and Kahn received the Turing Award in 2004. Discover their story <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/kahn_4598637.cfm" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <!-- Section 3: Early Programs on ARPANET -->
        <section class="content">
            <h2>2.3 Early Programs Used on ARPANET</h2>
            <h3>Who</h3>
            <p>Researchers developed early programs like email, FTP, and Gopher to explore the potential of networked communication.</p>

            <h3>What</h3>
            <p>Email and FTP were among the first applications, allowing for message exchanges and file transfers. Gopher was an early attempt at creating a text-based internet navigation system.</p>

            <h3>Why</h3>
            <p>These programs facilitated collaboration among institutions connected to ARPANET and paved the way for the World Wide Web.</p>

            <h3>When</h3>
            <p>Email was invented in 1971, while FTP became a standard for file transfers by 1973. Gopher was introduced in 1991 but was soon replaced by the World Wide Web.</p>

            <h3>How</h3>
            <p>Programs used packet-switching to transmit data across nodes, allowing for efficient communication. Learn more about early applications <a href="https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=1415" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
