        <h2>6.1. Web 3.0 & Semantic Web</h2>
        <h3>Who</h3>
        <p>The decentralized web, or Web 3.0, is being driven by blockchain developers, artificial intelligence researchers, and tech entrepreneurs who aim to create a more intelligent, decentralized web. The Semantic Web is a concept originally proposed by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web.</p>

        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>Web 3.0 represents the next evolution of the web, focused on decentralization through blockchain technology and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to enable more intelligent data handling. The Semantic Web is an extension of the current web where data is structured and tagged, allowing machines to understand and process information more effectively.</p>

        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>The aim of Web 3.0 is to return control of data and privacy to users, moving away from centralized platforms controlled by large tech companies. The Semantic Web is designed to improve the web's ability to understand and interpret content, facilitating better search results, recommendations, and automation.</p>

        <h3>When</h3>
        <p>The concept of the Semantic Web emerged in the early 2000s, but Web 3.0 gained traction in the 2020s with the rise of blockchain technologies and decentralized applications (dApps).</p>

        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>Web 3.0 relies on decentralized networks (blockchain), smart contracts, and AI to create a more secure, private, and intelligent web. The Semantic Web uses metadata, ontologies, and machine learning to give meaning to the content, making it machine-readable and processable at a deeper level.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <p>An example of Web 3.0 in action is the use of decentralized applications (dApps) on blockchain platforms like Ethereum. These applications allow users to perform transactions or access services without relying on a central authority or platform like Google or Facebook.</p>

        <h2>6.2. Internet of Things (IoT)</h2>
        <h3>Who</h3>
        <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is being driven by tech companies, hardware manufacturers, and network infrastructure providers such as Cisco, Google, and Amazon, as well as innovators in sectors like smart homes, healthcare, and automotive industries.</p>

        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>IoT refers to the network of physical devices ("things") connected to the internet, capable of collecting and sharing data. These devices range from household appliances to industrial sensors and medical devices.</p>

        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>The goal of IoT is to improve efficiency, automation, and decision-making by enabling devices to communicate with each other and with centralized systems. IoT devices help gather real-time data that can be used to optimize processes and improve user experiences.</p>

        <h3>When</h3>
        <p>The IoT concept gained widespread attention in the early 2010s, with rapid adoption in the mid-2010s, and it continues to expand rapidly with millions of connected devices entering the market every year.</p>

        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>IoT works by embedding sensors, software, and communication technologies into devices. These devices connect to the internet and communicate with each other using standardized communication protocols. Data collected by IoT devices is often processed in the cloud, where it can be analyzed and used to trigger automated responses or inform decision-making.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <p>A common example of IoT is a smart thermostat like the Nest, which can learn the user's schedule and adjust the temperature automatically for energy efficiency. It connects to the internet and can be controlled via a smartphone app.</p>

        <h2>6.3. Quantum Computing and Internet Technologies</h2>
        <h3>Who</h3>
        <p>Quantum computing research is being led by tech giants like IBM, Google, and Microsoft, as well as academic institutions and government agencies. These organizations are exploring how quantum computing can impact various industries, including internet infrastructure and cybersecurity.</p>

        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>Quantum computing is a revolutionary technology that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in ways that classical computers cannot. Quantum computers have the potential to dramatically enhance computational power, which could have a profound impact on internet technologies, particularly in areas like encryption, data processing, and artificial intelligence.</p>

        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>Quantum computing has the potential to solve complex problems that are currently beyond the reach of classical computers, such as optimizing internet infrastructure, breaking modern encryption methods, and revolutionizing machine learning algorithms. It could enable faster, more secure internet communications and provide solutions to problems that require massive computational power.</p>

        <h3>When</h3>
        <p>Although still in the experimental stage, quantum computing has made significant strides in the 2020s, with breakthroughs such as Google’s announcement of "quantum supremacy" in 2019. However, widespread practical applications may still be a decade away.</p>

        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>Quantum computers use qubits (quantum bits) that can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously, unlike classical bits which are either 0 or 1. This allows quantum computers to process multiple possibilities at once, vastly increasing computing power. In terms of internet technologies, quantum computing could help optimize data routing, develop unbreakable encryption (quantum cryptography), and improve the efficiency of data centers.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <p>An example of quantum computing’s potential impact is quantum cryptography, which could create encryption methods that are theoretically impossible to break, dramatically improving internet security.</p>
