## ARPANET

**Who:** ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was developed by the U.S. Department of Defense through ARPA (now DARPA) and is considered the precursor to the modern internet.

**What:** ARPANET was the first packet-switching network, and it allowed computers at different research institutions to communicate with each other. This network became the foundation for the development of the early internet.

**Why:** ARPANET was created to allow military and academic institutions to share information more efficiently. The goal was to develop a robust communication system that could function even if parts of the network were disrupted, as part of Cold War efforts to ensure communication resilience.

**When:** ARPANET was established in 1969, with the first successful communication occurring between UCLA and Stanford Research Institute. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, ARPANET grew, incorporating more nodes and contributing to the development of networking protocols.

**How:** ARPANET's key innovations included the use of packet-switching technology and the development of protocols like TCP/IP, which became the standard for data transmission on the internet. ARPANET's transition to TCP/IP in 1983 marked the official start of the modern internet.

**Example:** ARPANET was the first network to implement email as a communication tool, significantly influencing how early users of the internet communicated. This innovation, along with protocols like FTP (File Transfer Protocol), helped shape how people share data on the internet today.

## Vint Cerf & Bob Kahn

**Who:** Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn are American computer scientists widely regarded as two of the "fathers of the internet." They played a critical role in developing the foundational technologies that underpin the modern internet.

**What:** Cerf and Kahn co-authored the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), the fundamental communication protocols that define how data is transmitted and routed across networks. This work laid the groundwork for the architecture of the modern internet.

**Why:** The development of TCP/IP was necessary to allow different networks to interconnect and communicate seamlessly. At the time, there were many different networking systems, and TCP/IP provided a universal protocol that could support reliable data transmission across diverse and independent networks.

**When:** Cerf and Kahn developed TCP/IP in the early 1970s. Their landmark paper, "A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication," was published in 1974. By 1983, TCP/IP became the standard protocol for ARPANET, marking the true birth of the internet.

**How:** Kahn proposed the concept of open-architecture networking, which would allow different kinds of networks to interconnect. Cerf worked closely with him to develop the detailed design of the protocol, ultimately leading to the creation of TCP/IP. This protocol allowed for end-to-end communication, error correction, and data routing across different networks.

**Legacy:** TCP/IP is still the fundamental protocol suite used by the internet today. Cerf and Kahn's contributions made it possible for a wide range of networks, including ARPANET, to connect and evolve into the global internet. Their work directly enabled the creation of the World Wide Web, email, and other internet-based technologies that define modern life.

**Example:** In recognition of their contributions, both Cerf and Kahn have received numerous awards, including the Turing Award in 2004. Vint Cerf has also been a prominent advocate for internet governance and expansion, including work with Google as its Chief Internet Evangelist.

## Early programs used on ARPANET

**Who:** Early programs on ARPANET were developed by researchers, academics, and computer scientists who were experimenting with ways to communicate, share files, and explore the potential of networked computing. These early programs played a significant role in shaping how people interacted with networked systems.

**What:** Some of the first applications used on ARPANET included email, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), and Gopher. These programs allowed users to communicate, transfer files, and browse resources across the network. Email and FTP, in particular, became essential tools for communication and file-sharing on the growing network.

**Why:** These programs were created to facilitate communication and collaboration among academic and research institutions connected to ARPANET. Email became a revolutionary form of communication, while FTP allowed the easy exchange of research documents and data. Gopher, though eventually replaced by the World Wide Web, was an early attempt to create a navigable information retrieval system.

**When:** ARPANET became operational in 1969, and by the early 1970s, key programs like email (invented in 1971 by Ray Tomlinson) and FTP (developed in 1971) were in regular use. Gopher, a file-sharing and information retrieval protocol, was introduced later, in 1991, and influenced how early users navigated and retrieved files.

**How:** These programs used ARPANET's packet-switching technology to transmit data between different nodes on the network. Email allowed for sending messages between users, FTP enabled file transfers, and Gopher provided a simple, text-based way to browse and retrieve documents on remote servers. While email and FTP have evolved and remain in use today, Gopher's hierarchical menu-based interface was eventually eclipsed by the more user-friendly and visually engaging World Wide Web.

**Example:** **Email** was one of the earliest "killer apps" on ARPANET, revolutionizing how people communicated. **FTP** allowed researchers to share large datasets and documents. **Gopher** was an early predecessor to the World Wide Web, using a hierarchical menu-based interface to help users find and retrieve files, though it was later replaced by the rise of the web and HTML.
