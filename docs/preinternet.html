    <h1>Pre Internet</h1>

    <h2>JC Licklider</h2>
    <p><strong>Who:</strong> Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider, commonly known as JC Licklider, was an American psychologist
        and computer scientist.</p>
    <p><strong>What:</strong> Licklider was a pioneer in computer science and played a key role in conceptualizing and
        developing the early ideas that eventually led to the creation of the internet. He is best known for his ideas
        about human-computer interaction and his vision of a globally connected network of computers, which he called
        the "Intergalactic Computer Network."</p>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong> Licklider believed that computers could enhance human capabilities, especially in
        communication and collaboration. His vision laid the foundation for the development of ARPANET, the precursor to
        the modern internet.</p>
    <p><strong>When:</strong> In the early 1960s, Licklider's work at ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency)
        significantly influenced the development of time-sharing systems and networked computing.</p>
    <p><strong>How:</strong> Licklider's influence came from his role at ARPA, where he funded and directed research
        projects focused on networking and time-sharing. His work brought together scientists and engineers who would
        later create ARPANET, which became the framework for today's internet.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> One of his key contributions was writing the influential paper "Man-Computer
        Symbiosis," which outlined his vision for a future in which humans and computers work together interactively.
    </p>

    <h2>Nuclear Weapons</h2>
    <p><strong>Who:</strong> The development and stockpiling of nuclear weapons during the Cold War primarily involved
        global superpowers, including the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
    <p><strong>What:</strong> The presence of nuclear weapons, and the fear of their potential use, was a driving force
        behind the development of robust communication networks. The U.S. government sought to create a decentralized
        communication system that could survive a nuclear attack.</p>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong> The threat of nuclear war led to concerns about maintaining command and control over
        military and governmental communications in the event of widespread destruction. A decentralized network was
        seen as a solution to ensure communication continuity.</p>
    <p><strong>When:</strong> In the 1960s, during the Cold War, the U.S. Department of Defense initiated efforts to
        create communication systems that could withstand large-scale attacks, including nuclear strikes.</p>
    <p><strong>How:</strong> This need for a resilient communication network led to the development of ARPANET, a
        network designed to reroute data through different paths if certain nodes were destroyed. ARPANET eventually
        evolved into the modern internet.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> One key innovation was packet-switching technology, which allowed information to be
        broken down into smaller packets and transmitted via multiple routes, increasing the network's survivability
        during a potential nuclear event.</p>

    <h2>ARPA (Advanced Research Project Agency)</h2>
    <p><strong>Who:</strong> ARPA, later renamed DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), is a U.S. government
        agency created to oversee and fund research in defense-related technologies.</p>
    <p><strong>What:</strong> ARPA played a pivotal role in the development of the early internet through its creation
        of ARPANET, the first packet-switching network. ARPANET became the foundation of the modern internet.</p>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong> In response to the Soviet Union's technological advances (such as the launch of Sputnik),
        the U.S. government established ARPA in 1958 to ensure that the U.S. remained a leader in military technology,
        including advanced communication systems.</p>
    <p><strong>When:</strong> ARPA was founded in 1958, and its influence on networking technology became clear in the
        1960s with the funding and development of ARPANET, which began in 1969.</p>
    <p><strong>How:</strong> ARPA funded research in computer networking, specifically the development of
        packet-switching technology and time-sharing systems. Through ARPANET, ARPA connected various research
        institutions, allowing for data-sharing and communication between them, which laid the groundwork for the global
        internet.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> ARPA funded the work of key pioneers like Paul Baran and Lawrence Roberts, who were
        instrumental in designing ARPANETâ€™s packet-switching framework, ensuring that communication could continue even
        if parts of the network were destroyed.</p>
