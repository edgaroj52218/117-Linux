    <h1>Web 1.0</h1>
    <h2>HTML / HTTP Protocol (HTTP Browser/Server). Tim Berners Lee (Creator)</h2>
    <p><strong>Who:</strong> Tim Berners-Lee is a British computer scientist who is credited with inventing the World Wide Web. He created the fundamental technologies that made the web possible, including HTML and HTTP.</p>
    <p><strong>What:</strong> HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and format documents on the web. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used by web browsers to communicate with web servers. Together, they form the backbone of the World Wide Web.</p>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong> Tim Berners-Lee developed these technologies to make information sharing on the internet more accessible and interconnected. Before HTML and HTTP, the internet was mostly used for text-based communication, but these innovations allowed for multimedia-rich web pages and hyperlinks that connected documents across the globe.</p>
    <p><strong>When:</strong> Tim Berners-Lee created the first version of HTML and HTTP in 1989-1990 while working at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research). The first web page went live in 1991, marking the birth of the World Wide Web.</p>
    <p><strong>How:</strong> HTML provides the structure and content for web pages, while HTTP defines how data is exchanged between a web browser (client) and a server. When you enter a URL into your browser, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server, which then responds with the requested HTML document, rendering it in the browser. This simple but powerful interaction enabled the creation of the first websites, forming the basis of Web 1.0.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> The first website, created by Berners-Lee, was an informational page about the World Wide Web project itself, detailing how users could create and access web pages using HTML and HTTP. This innovation allowed for static, text-based pages with hyperlinks, which were characteristic of the Web 1.0 era.</p>

    <h2>Javascript</h2>
    <p><strong>Who:</strong> JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich, a programmer at Netscape Communications Corporation. It was introduced in 1995 to enhance user interactions on websites during the early days of the web (Web 1.0).</p>
    <p><strong>What:</strong> JavaScript is a scripting language that brought interactivity to otherwise static web pages in Web 1.0. While Web 1.0 primarily consisted of text and static content, JavaScript allowed developers to add simple dynamic features like pop-up windows, form validation, and basic animations.</p>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong> JavaScript was introduced to make web pages more interactive and engaging for users without needing to reload the entire page. In Web 1.0, most websites were static, and any form of user interaction required communication with the server. JavaScript allowed for client-side interactions, improving the user experience.</p>
    <p><strong>When:</strong> JavaScript was first released in 1995 as part of Netscape Navigator 2.0. It became one of the core components of Web 1.0, alongside HTML and CSS, and was one of the first programming languages that ran directly in the browser.</p>
    <p><strong>How:</strong> In Web 1.0, JavaScript was used to manipulate HTML elements dynamically within a browser, allowing users to interact with elements like buttons, forms, and text fields. While the early uses of JavaScript were simple compared to modern standards, they set the foundation for the more interactive web experiences that followed.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A common Web 1.0 use case was client-side form validation. JavaScript could check if a user entered a valid email address or filled out all required fields before sending the data to the server. Other examples include basic image rollovers and small pop-up alerts that gave users immediate feedback.</p>

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p><strong>Who:</strong> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was developed by Håkon Wium Lie while working at CERN and later proposed in 1994. It was officially adopted as a W3C standard in 1996.</p>
    <p><strong>What:</strong> CSS is a style sheet language used to control the presentation of HTML documents. In Web 1.0, CSS allowed web developers to separate content (HTML) from design (CSS), making it easier to apply consistent styling across multiple web pages.</p>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong> Before CSS, all styling had to be applied directly within HTML using inline or embedded styles, which made maintaining and updating websites cumbersome. CSS was created to allow developers to define styles in a separate file, reducing code duplication and making website management more efficient.</p>
    <p><strong>When:</strong> CSS was first proposed in 1994 and became a W3C recommendation in 1996. Although it was not widely adopted in the early days of Web 1.0, it gradually gained popularity as browsers began to support the standard more fully by the late 1990s.</p>
    <p><strong>How:</strong> CSS works by targeting HTML elements and applying visual styles, such as colors, fonts, and layout properties. During Web 1.0, CSS was mostly used for basic design tasks like changing font styles, background colors, and adding simple margins or padding. The separation of structure (HTML) and presentation (CSS) made it easier to create more visually appealing and manageable websites.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A typical Web 1.0 example would be using CSS to style all the headers (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> through <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>) on a website uniformly, applying the same font and color across the entire site without needing to manually style each header tag in HTML.</p>

    <h2>Perl & PHP Server Side</h2>
    <p><strong>Who:</strong> <strong>Perl</strong> was developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose programming language, and <strong>PHP</strong> (Personal Home Page, now Hypertext Preprocessor) was created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 for dynamic web development.</p>
    <p><strong>What:</strong> Both Perl and PHP were used as server-side scripting languages during the Web 1.0 era, enabling dynamic content generation. Server-side scripts run on the web server, processing user inputs and returning web pages customized for each request. These technologies were crucial in transforming static websites into more interactive experiences.</p>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong> Web 1.0 sites were mostly static, with content that was the same for every user. Perl and PHP enabled the development of dynamic websites, where content could be customized based on user interactions or data from a database. This allowed early websites to handle things like form submissions, content management, and session tracking.</p>
    <p><strong>When:</strong> Perl was widely used in the early 1990s for web development due to its powerful text-processing capabilities. PHP was introduced in 1994 and quickly became popular for embedding scripts directly within HTML pages, allowing for easier server-side web development as Web 1.0 matured.</p>
    <p><strong>How:</strong> Perl was commonly used in CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripts that processed user inputs and generated dynamic web pages. PHP, on the other hand, allowed developers to embed server-side logic directly into HTML pages, which simplified the creation of dynamic web pages. Both languages worked by running on the server, generating HTML that was sent to the client's browser.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A Web 1.0 example using Perl would be a CGI script that processed a user’s form submission (e.g., a contact form) and returned a confirmation page. A PHP example would be an early dynamic web page that pulled content from a database and displayed it based on user preferences, such as showing different news articles depending on the date.</p>

    <h2>Linux</h2>
    <p><strong>Who:</strong> Linux was created by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer science student, in 1991. It was developed as an open-source operating system kernel, with contributions from developers around the world through collaborative projects.</p>
    <p><strong>What:</strong> Linux is a Unix-like operating system that became popular for web servers during the Web 1.0 era due to its stability, flexibility, and open-source nature. It allowed developers to host and manage websites efficiently, offering an alternative to proprietary systems like Windows and Unix.</p>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong> During Web 1.0, Linux emerged as a preferred operating system for web servers because it was free to use and modify, which was attractive to many early web developers. It also offered strong security, performance, and scalability, making it ideal for running web hosting services and applications.</p>
    <p><strong>When:</strong> Linux was first released in 1991 as a kernel, and by the mid-1990s, it had gained significant popularity as a server operating system. Many early Web 1.0 websites were hosted on Linux servers, particularly as open-source web technologies like Apache (web server software) and PHP gained traction.</p>
    <p><strong>How:</strong> Linux was used primarily on servers to host websites and run services that supported the early internet, such as email, databases, and FTP. It became a foundation for the open-source web development movement, providing the platform for many of the web’s early servers and influencing the broader adoption of open-source technologies in Web 1.0.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> In Web 1.0, popular web servers like Apache often ran on Linux systems. Many web developers and companies chose Linux for its performance, reliability, and ability to easily integrate with other web technologies, such as MySQL databases and scripting languages like PHP and Perl, which were also popular in the early internet.</p>

    <h2>Early Search Engines</h2>
    <p><strong>Who:</strong> Early search engines were developed by a mix of academic researchers and companies trying to help users navigate the growing amount of information on the web. Notable early search engines included <strong>Archie</strong> (1990), <strong>Lycos</strong> (1994), <strong>AltaVista</strong> (1995), <strong>Yahoo!</strong> (1995), and <strong>HotBot</strong> (1996).</p>
    <p><strong>What:</strong> Early search engines were created to index web content and allow users to search for relevant information across different websites. They worked by crawling the web, indexing pages, and enabling keyword-based search queries.</p>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong> As the web expanded in the Web 1.0 era, users needed a way to find information among the growing number of websites. Early search engines were designed to make this process more efficient by creating searchable indexes of web pages, which helped users locate specific content.</p>
    <p><strong>When:</strong> Search engines like Archie appeared as early as 1990, before the web itself had fully taken shape. By the mid-1990s, search engines such as Lycos, AltaVista, Yahoo!, and HotBot emerged and became some of the most popular tools for navigating the internet in Web 1.0.</p>
    <p><strong>How:</strong> These search engines used algorithms to crawl and index web pages, ranking them based on factors like relevance, keyword density, and backlinks. Some, like Yahoo!, initially functioned as directories with human editors curating lists of websites, while others like AltaVista and HotBot pioneered automatic, algorithm-driven indexing and search.</p>
    
    <h4>What Happened to Them?</h4>
    <p><strong>Archie:</strong> The first search engine for locating FTP sites. It became obsolete as the World Wide Web grew, and more advanced search engines emerged. <strong>Failed.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Lycos:</strong> Initially successful and one of the first major search engines, but it struggled to compete with later search engines like Google. Today, Lycos still exists but operates on a much smaller scale. <strong>Failed in the search engine space, survives in other areas.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>AltaVista:</strong> Once a highly popular search engine due to its fast and comprehensive indexing. It was acquired by Yahoo! in 2003 and eventually shut down in 2013 as Yahoo! focused on its own search engine. <strong>Failed.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Yahoo!:</strong> Originally a web directory, Yahoo! developed into one of the biggest early search engines and internet portals. However, Yahoo! eventually lost ground to Google. Yahoo! still exists today, though it has greatly diminished in influence. <strong>Partially succeeded but lost dominance to Google.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>HotBot:</strong> Launched in 1996, HotBot was known for its speed and innovative features like advanced search filtering. It was one of the first search engines to index large volumes of web pages quickly. However, it lost relevance with the rise of Google and other competitors. HotBot still exists but is no longer a major player. <strong>Failed.</strong></p>
