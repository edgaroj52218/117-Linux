    <h1>Web 2.0</h1>
    <h2>Google Search - Page Rank</h2>
    <p><strong>Who:</strong> Google Search was developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the co-founders of Google. The
        key innovation behind Google’s search engine was the PageRank algorithm, which was introduced in the late 1990s
        and became the foundation of Google's search success in the Web 2.0 era.</p>
    <p><strong>What:</strong> PageRank is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank web pages in search engine results.
        Unlike earlier search engines that relied mainly on keyword matching, PageRank analyzed the links between web
        pages to determine their importance and relevance. Pages with more high-quality inbound links were ranked higher
        in search results.</p>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong> The development of PageRank was critical in addressing the limitations of Web 1.0 search
        engines, which often produced irrelevant results. Web 2.0, with its explosion of user-generated content and
        collaborative websites, required a more sophisticated ranking system to deliver accurate and useful search
        results. PageRank allowed Google to rise above competitors by prioritizing quality and relevance in search
        results.</p>
    <p><strong>When:</strong> PageRank was first introduced with the launch of Google Search in 1998. It became a
        central element of Google’s search algorithm as Web 2.0 technologies began to take off in the mid-2000s,
        enabling Google to dominate the search engine market.</p>
    <p><strong>How:</strong> PageRank works by analyzing the number and quality of links pointing to a web page. Each
        link is considered a "vote" of confidence, and pages with more high-quality links are deemed more important and
        ranked higher. Google also factors in the relevance of the content to the user’s search query. As Web 2.0
        expanded, PageRank continued to evolve with additional factors like user behavior, location, and content
        freshness.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> When you search for a term like “best smartphones,” PageRank helps Google determine
        which pages are most authoritative and relevant by analyzing how many other trusted sites link to a particular
        page. Pages from well-known tech websites are more likely to rank higher than smaller, lesser-known sources.</p>

    <h2>Roy Fielding and REST Dissertation</h2>
    <p><strong>Who:</strong> Roy Fielding is a computer scientist and one of the principal authors of the HTTP
        specification. He is best known for his dissertation that introduced the concept of REST (Representational State
        Transfer), which became a foundational architectural style for Web 2.0.</p>
    <p><strong>What:</strong> REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications, particularly for the
        web. In his 2000 dissertation, Fielding described REST as a set of principles for building scalable and
        efficient web services. RESTful services use HTTP to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations,
        with each resource represented by a URL, making them easier to integrate and scale across platforms.</p>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong> As Web 2.0 emerged, characterized by rich user interaction, dynamic content, and the rise
        of APIs, the need for a more efficient and standardized way to build web services became apparent. REST provided
        a simpler, more flexible alternative to earlier protocols like SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), which were
        more complex and resource-intensive. REST became essential in enabling the creation of interactive, user-driven
        applications such as social media, e-commerce, and cloud-based services.</p>
    <p><strong>When:</strong> Roy Fielding’s dissertation was published in 2000, but REST gained widespread adoption
        with the rise of Web 2.0 in the mid-2000s as developers sought lightweight, scalable methods to connect web
        applications and services through APIs.</p>
    <p><strong>How:</strong> RESTful services follow six architectural constraints, including statelessness, uniform
        interface, and resource-based URLs. These principles allow web services to be more scalable, reliable, and
        efficient. REST APIs have been widely adopted by Web 2.0 platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Amazon, allowing
        developers to interact with these services and create rich, interactive web applications.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A common RESTful API request in a Web 2.0 application might be an HTTP GET request to
        retrieve user data from a social media platform: <code>GET https://api.socialmedia.com/users/{userID}</code>.
        This request returns the user information in a standardized format like JSON, allowing easy integration with
        other web applications.</p>

    <h2>Ryan Dahl (Node.js / JavaScript)</h2>
    <p><strong>Who:</strong> Ryan Dahl is an American software engineer who created Node.js, a runtime environment that
        allows JavaScript to be executed server-side. His work revolutionized the way web applications are developed,
        particularly in the Web 2.0 era, where real-time, interactive web services became increasingly popular.</p>
    <p><strong>What:</strong> Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows
        developers to use JavaScript for server-side scripting, enabling the creation of dynamic and scalable network
        applications. Before Node.js, JavaScript was mainly used for client-side development, but Dahl's innovation
        extended its reach to the back end, promoting full-stack JavaScript development.</p>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong> As Web 2.0 ushered in more dynamic, interactive, and real-time applications (such as social
        media, live chats, and streaming services), traditional server technologies struggled to handle
        high-concurrency, low-latency requirements. Node.js, with its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, offered a
        highly efficient way to build scalable network applications, particularly for real-time data-heavy environments.
    </p>
    <p><strong>When:</strong> Ryan Dahl introduced Node.js in 2009. The project quickly gained popularity as part of the
        Web 2.0 movement, allowing developers to build fast, scalable, and lightweight web applications. Its
        introduction marked a turning point in how web applications were built, giving rise to the "JavaScript
        everywhere" paradigm.</p>
    <p><strong>How:</strong> Node.js works by executing JavaScript code on the server side, handling many concurrent
        connections efficiently through its event-driven architecture. This allows developers to build high-performance,
        real-time applications like chat servers or live content streaming using a single programming language
        (JavaScript) across both the front end and back end. It also integrates with popular Web 2.0 technologies like
        RESTful APIs and JSON.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A classic use case for Node.js is a real-time chat application where multiple users can
        send and receive messages simultaneously. With its non-blocking I/O, Node.js can handle thousands of connections
        at once, providing a seamless real-time experience that’s crucial for modern Web 2.0 applications.</p>

    <h2>Python Guide & Van Rossum</h2>
    <p><strong>Who:</strong> Guido van Rossum is a Dutch computer programmer and the creator of Python, one of the most
        popular programming languages in the world. His work on Python has had a profound impact on the development of
        Web 2.0 applications due to Python's simplicity, readability, and versatility.</p>
    <p><strong>What:</strong> Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its clean and
        easy-to-read syntax. It became highly popular in Web 2.0 for backend development, web frameworks, and the
        growing demand for rapid application development. Python’s web frameworks, such as Django and Flask, have been
        widely adopted for building scalable, secure, and dynamic web applications.</p>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong> Python was designed to be an easy-to-learn language that emphasizes code readability and
        developer productivity. As Web 2.0 platforms evolved to support more dynamic, data-driven, and interactive
        applications, Python’s simplicity and efficiency made it ideal for web development, especially with the rise of
        frameworks like Django, which allowed rapid development of robust web apps.</p>
    <p><strong>When:</strong> Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, but its popularity surged during the Web
        2.0 era in the mid-2000s. With frameworks like Django (released in 2005) and Flask (released in 2010), Python
        became a go-to language for developers building scalable web applications during the Web 2.0 boom.</p>
    <p><strong>How:</strong> Python is widely used for building web applications, APIs, and data-driven platforms. With
        frameworks like Django, developers could build powerful Web 2.0 applications quickly, focusing on high-level
        functionality without worrying about low-level details like database management or security. Python’s
        compatibility with a wide range of libraries and tools, along with its support for RESTful services and APIs,
        made it a perfect fit for modern Web 2.0 applications.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Django, a Python web framework, is often used to build content management systems
        (CMS), e-commerce platforms, and social media websites. For example, Instagram, a prominent Web 2.0 platform,
        was originally built using Python and the Django framework due to its ability to scale efficiently while
        maintaining code simplicity.</p>

    <h2>Git, Linus Torvalds</h2>
    <p><strong>Who:</strong> Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux operating system, also developed Git in 2005. Git
        is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with
        speed and efficiency. It became a cornerstone tool in the Web 2.0 era for managing source code and collaboration
        among developers.</p>
    <p><strong>What:</strong> Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code,
        collaborate across different locations, and manage projects more effectively. It was created to support the
        development of the Linux kernel but has since become the most widely used version control system in software
        development, particularly during the rise of Web 2.0 technologies.</p>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong> As Web 2.0 introduced more complex, collaborative, and globally distributed software
        development projects, there was a growing need for a reliable, fast, and flexible version control system. Git
        allowed multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, handle branching and merging of code
        efficiently, and maintain a comprehensive history of changes. This made Git essential in open-source and
        large-scale Web 2.0 development projects.</p>
    <p><strong>When:</strong> Git was released by Linus Torvalds in 2005, following a dispute with BitKeeper, the
        proprietary version control system previously used by the Linux kernel development team. Git quickly gained
        traction in the open-source community and became the de facto standard for version control in the Web 2.0 era,
        especially with the rise of GitHub in 2008, which made Git even more accessible to developers worldwide.</p>
    <p><strong>How:</strong> Git works by tracking changes in the source code and storing snapshots of the project at
        different points in time. Developers can create branches to work on features independently and then merge their
        changes back into the main project when ready. Git's distributed nature means that every developer has a full
        copy of the project’s history, making it highly resilient and fast. Web 2.0 projects, especially those involving
        open-source collaboration, benefited greatly from Git's ability to handle multiple contributors and complex
        workflows.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A typical Web 2.0 use case for Git would be in large, collaborative projects like the
        development of an open-source web framework (e.g., React or Angular). Git allows thousands of developers to
        contribute code, create feature branches, and submit pull requests, all while maintaining an organized and
        efficient workflow. GitHub, built on Git, has become a key platform for hosting and managing these collaborative
        efforts.</p>
