        <h2>2.1 ARPANET</h2>
        <h3>Who</h3>
        <p>ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was developed by the U.S. Department of Defense through ARPA (now DARPA) and is considered the precursor to the modern internet.</p>

        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>ARPANET was the first packet-switching network, allowing computers at different research institutions to communicate with each other. This network became the foundation for the development of the early internet.</p>

        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>ARPANET was created to allow military and academic institutions to share information efficiently. The goal was to develop a robust communication system that could function even if parts of the network were disrupted, ensuring communication resilience.</p>

        <h3>When</h3>
        <p>ARPANET was established in 1969, with the first successful communication between UCLA and Stanford Research Institute. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, ARPANET grew and contributed to the development of networking protocols.</p>

        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>ARPANET’s key innovations included packet-switching technology and the development of TCP/IP protocols, which became the standard for data transmission. The transition to TCP/IP in 1983 marked the official start of the modern internet.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <p>ARPANET was the first network to implement email, significantly influencing how early users communicated. This, along with protocols like FTP, shaped how data is shared on the internet today.</p>

        <h2>2.2 Vint Cerf & Bob Kahn</h2>
        <h3>Who</h3>
        <p>Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn are American computer scientists widely regarded as the "fathers of the internet." They played a critical role in developing the technologies that underpin the modern internet.</p>

        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>Cerf and Kahn co-authored the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), fundamental communication protocols that define how data is transmitted across networks.</p>

        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>The development of TCP/IP was necessary to allow different networks to interconnect and communicate seamlessly. TCP/IP provided a universal protocol supporting reliable data transmission across independent networks.</p>

        <h3>When</h3>
        <p>Cerf and Kahn developed TCP/IP in the early 1970s. Their paper "A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication" was published in 1974. By 1983, TCP/IP became the standard protocol for ARPANET, marking the birth of the modern internet.</p>

        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>Kahn proposed open-architecture networking, allowing different networks to interconnect. Cerf worked closely with him to design TCP/IP, enabling end-to-end communication, error correction, and data routing across networks.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <p>Both Cerf and Kahn received numerous awards for their contributions, including the Turing Award in 2004. Cerf has also worked with Google as its Chief Internet Evangelist, promoting internet governance and expansion.</p>

        <h2>2.3 Early Programs Used on ARPANET</h2>
        <h3>Who</h3>
        <p>Early programs on ARPANET were developed by researchers and computer scientists experimenting with network communication, file sharing, and exploring the potential of networked computing.</p>

        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>Some of the first applications on ARPANET included email, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), and Gopher. These programs enabled communication, file transfers, and browsing across the network.</p>

        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>These programs facilitated communication and collaboration among institutions connected to ARPANET. Email revolutionized communication, and FTP enabled the easy exchange of research documents and data.</p>

        <h3>When</h3>
        <p>By the early 1970s, key programs like email (invented in 1971 by Ray Tomlinson) and FTP (developed in 1971) were in regular use. Gopher, introduced later in 1991, provided an early attempt at a navigable information retrieval system.</p>

        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>These programs used ARPANET’s packet-switching technology to transmit data between different nodes. Email allowed message exchanges, FTP enabled file transfers, and Gopher provided a simple, text-based browsing system. While email and FTP remain in use today, Gopher was eventually replaced by the World Wide Web.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <p>Email became one of the earliest "killer apps" on ARPANET, revolutionizing communication. FTP allowed researchers to share large datasets, while Gopher, though eventually replaced, was an early predecessor to the World Wide Web.</p>
