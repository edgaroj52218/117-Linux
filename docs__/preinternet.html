        <h2>1.1 JC Licklider</h2>
        <h3>Who</h3>
        <p>Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider, commonly known as JC Licklider, was an American psychologist and computer scientist.</p>

        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>Licklider was a pioneer in computer science and played a key role in conceptualizing and developing early ideas that eventually led to the creation of the internet. He is best known for his vision of a globally connected network of computers, which he called the "Intergalactic Computer Network."</p>

        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>He believed computers could enhance human capabilities, especially in communication and collaboration. His ideas laid the foundation for ARPANET, the precursor to the modern internet.</p>

        <h3>When</h3>
        <p>In the early 1960s, Licklider's work at ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) greatly influenced the development of time-sharing systems and networked computing.</p>

        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>Through his role at ARPA, Licklider funded and directed research projects focused on networking and time-sharing, bringing together scientists who would later create ARPANET.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <p>Licklider's paper, "Man-Computer Symbiosis," outlined his vision of a future where humans and computers work together interactively.</p>

        <h2>1.2 Nuclear Weapons</h2>
        <h3>Who</h3>
        <p>The development and stockpiling of nuclear weapons during the Cold War primarily involved global superpowers, including the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>

        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>The presence of nuclear weapons and the fear of their use were major factors behind the development of robust communication networks. The U.S. government sought a decentralized system that could survive a nuclear attack.</p>

        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>The threat of nuclear war led to concerns about maintaining command and control over military communications in the event of widespread destruction. A decentralized network was seen as essential for communication continuity.</p>

        <h3>When</h3>
        <p>In the 1960s, during the Cold War, the U.S. Department of Defense initiated efforts to create communication systems resilient enough to withstand nuclear attacks.</p>

        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>This led to the development of ARPANET, a network designed to reroute data through multiple paths if certain nodes were destroyed. ARPANET became the foundation of the modern internet.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <p>Packet-switching technology was a key innovation, allowing information to be transmitted via multiple routes, increasing the network’s survivability in the event of a nuclear attack.</p>

        <h2>1.3 ARPA (Advanced Research Project Agency)</h2>
        <h3>Who</h3>
        <p>ARPA, later renamed DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), is a U.S. government agency created to fund research in defense-related technologies.</p>

        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>ARPA played a pivotal role in the development of the early internet through the creation of ARPANET, the first packet-switching network that laid the foundation for the modern internet.</p>

        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>In response to the Soviet Union's technological advances, such as the launch of Sputnik, the U.S. government established ARPA in 1958 to ensure that the U.S. remained at the forefront of military and technological innovation.</p>

        <h3>When</h3>
        <p>Founded in 1958, ARPA’s influence on networking technology became clear in the 1960s with the development of ARPANET, which began in 1969.</p>

        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>ARPA funded research in computer networking, specifically in packet-switching and time-sharing technologies. Through ARPANET, ARPA connected research institutions, allowing for data sharing, which ultimately evolved into the global internet.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <p>ARPA funded the work of pioneers like Paul Baran and Lawrence Roberts, who designed ARPANET’s packet-switching framework, ensuring communication could continue even if parts of the network were destroyed.</p>
