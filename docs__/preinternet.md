# Pre Internet

## JC Licklider

**Who:** Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider, commonly known as JC Licklider, was an American psychologist and computer scientist.

**What:** Licklider was a pioneer in computer science and played a key role in conceptualizing and developing the early ideas that eventually led to the creation of the internet. He is best known for his ideas about human-computer interaction and his vision of a globally connected network of computers, which he called the "Intergalactic Computer Network."

**Why:** Licklider believed that computers could enhance human capabilities, especially in communication and collaboration. His vision laid the foundation for the development of ARPANET, the precursor to the modern internet.

**When:** In the early 1960s, Licklider's work at ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) significantly influenced the development of time-sharing systems and networked computing.

**How:** Licklider's influence came from his role at ARPA, where he funded and directed research projects focused on networking and time-sharing. His work brought together scientists and engineers who would later create ARPANET, which became the framework for today's internet.

**Example:** One of his key contributions was writing the influential paper "Man-Computer Symbiosis," which outlined his vision for a future in which humans and computers work together interactively.

## Nuclear Weapons

**Who:** The development and stockpiling of nuclear weapons during the Cold War primarily involved global superpowers, including the United States and the Soviet Union.

**What:** The presence of nuclear weapons, and the fear of their potential use, was a driving force behind the development of robust communication networks. The U.S. government sought to create a decentralized communication system that could survive a nuclear attack.

**Why:** The threat of nuclear war led to concerns about maintaining command and control over military and governmental communications in the event of widespread destruction. A decentralized network was seen as a solution to ensure communication continuity.

**When:** In the 1960s, during the Cold War, the U.S. Department of Defense initiated efforts to create communication systems that could withstand large-scale attacks, including nuclear strikes.

**How:** This need for a resilient communication network led to the development of ARPANET, a network designed to reroute data through different paths if certain nodes were destroyed. ARPANET eventually evolved into the modern internet.

**Example:** One key innovation was packet-switching technology, which allowed information to be broken down into smaller packets and transmitted via multiple routes, increasing the network's survivability during a potential nuclear event.

## ARPA (Advanced Research Project Agency)

**Who:** ARPA, later renamed DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), is a U.S. government agency created to oversee and fund research in defense-related technologies.

**What:** ARPA played a pivotal role in the development of the early internet through its creation of ARPANET, the first packet-switching network. ARPANET became the foundation of the modern internet.

**Why:** In response to the Soviet Union's technological advances (such as the launch of Sputnik), the U.S. government established ARPA in 1958 to ensure that the U.S. remained a leader in military technology, including advanced communication systems.

**When:** ARPA was founded in 1958, and its influence on networking technology became clear in the 1960s with the funding and development of ARPANET, which began in 1969.

**How:** ARPA funded research in computer networking, specifically the development of packet-switching technology and time-sharing systems. Through ARPANET, ARPA connected various research institutions, allowing for data-sharing and communication between them, which laid the groundwork for the global internet.

**Example:** ARPA funded the work of key pioneers like Paul Baran and Lawrence Roberts, who were instrumental in designing ARPANETâ€™s packet-switching framework, ensuring that communication could continue even if parts of the network were destroyed.
