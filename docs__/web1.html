        <h2>3.1 HTML / HTTP Protocol (HTTP Browser/Server). Tim Berners-Lee (Creator)</h2>
        <h3>Who</h3>
        <p>Tim Berners-Lee is a British computer scientist who invented the World Wide Web. He created the core technologies that made the web possible, including HTML and HTTP.</p>

        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language for creating documents on the web, and HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol that web browsers use to communicate with web servers.</p>

        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>Berners-Lee developed these technologies to make information sharing on the internet more accessible. Before HTML and HTTP, the internet was primarily used for text-based communication, but these innovations allowed for multimedia-rich web pages and hyperlinks.</p>

        <h3>When</h3>
        <p>He created the first version of HTML and HTTP between 1989-1990 while working at CERN. The first web page went live in 1991, marking the birth of the World Wide Web.</p>

        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>HTML structures web pages, while HTTP defines how data is exchanged between a browser and a server. This interaction formed the basis of the first websites, enabling the creation of static, text-based pages with hyperlinks.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <p>The first website, created by Berners-Lee, was an informational page about the World Wide Web project, explaining how users could create and access web pages using HTML and HTTP.</p>

        <h2>3.2 JavaScript</h2>
        <h3>Who</h3>
        <p>JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich, a programmer at Netscape Communications Corporation, in 1995.</p>

        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that brought interactivity to static web pages during the Web 1.0 era. It allowed developers to add dynamic features like pop-ups, form validation, and basic animations.</p>

        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>JavaScript was introduced to make web pages more interactive without requiring a full reload. Before JavaScript, most websites were static, and any form of user interaction required communication with the server.</p>

        <h3>When</h3>
        <p>JavaScript was first released in 1995 as part of Netscape Navigator 2.0, becoming one of the core components of Web 1.0.</p>

        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>In Web 1.0, JavaScript was used to dynamically manipulate HTML elements within the browser, allowing users to interact with elements like forms and buttons without reloading the page.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <p>A common Web 1.0 use case was client-side form validation, where JavaScript would check if a user entered a valid email before sending the data to the server.</p>

        <h2>3.3 CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h2>
        <h3>Who</h3>
        <p>CSS was developed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie while working at CERN and was officially adopted as a W3C standard in 1996.</p>

        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>CSS is a style sheet language used to control the presentation of HTML documents, allowing developers to separate content (HTML) from design (CSS).</p>

        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>Before CSS, all styling was applied directly within HTML, making it difficult to maintain and update websites. CSS enabled developers to define styles separately, reducing code duplication and making website management easier.</p>

        <h3>When</h3>
        <p>CSS was first proposed in 1994 and became a W3C recommendation in 1996, though it was not widely adopted until browsers began supporting it in the late 1990s.</p>

        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>CSS works by targeting HTML elements and applying visual styles like colors, fonts, and layouts. In Web 1.0, CSS was used mainly for basic design tasks, such as changing fonts or background colors.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <p>During Web 1.0, CSS was commonly used to style headers (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> through <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>) consistently across a website, applying the same font and color to all headings without manually styling each one in HTML.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>3.4 Perl & PHP Server-Side Technologies</h2>
        <h3>Who</h3>
        <p>Perl was developed by Larry Wall in 1987, and PHP (Personal Home Page, now Hypertext Preprocessor) was created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 for dynamic web development.</p>

        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>Perl and PHP are server-side scripting languages that allowed websites to generate dynamic content. These technologies helped move beyond static pages, providing customized responses to user inputs.</p>

        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>Web 1.0 sites were mostly static, and Perl and PHP enabled the creation of dynamic websites, where content could change based on user interactions or data from a database.</p>

        <h3>When</h3>
        <p>Perl was widely used in the early 1990s, and PHP was introduced in 1994. Both languages played important roles in the evolution of dynamic web development during Web 1.0.</p>

        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>Perl was commonly used in CGI scripts, while PHP allowed server-side logic to be embedded directly in HTML. Both languages generated HTML content dynamically based on user input or server data.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <p>A Perl CGI script might process a form submission and return a confirmation page, while PHP could pull data from a database to display personalized content based on user preferences.</p>
        </div>

    <section>
        <h2>3.5 Linux</h2>
        <h3>Who</h3>
        <p>Linux was created by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer science student, in 1991 as an open-source operating system kernel.</p>

        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>Linux is a Unix-like operating system widely used on web servers during Web 1.0 due to its stability, flexibility, and open-source nature, offering a free alternative to proprietary systems.</p>

        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>Linux's open-source model made it popular among developers, while its stability and security made it ideal for running web servers.</p>

        <h3>When</h3>
        <p>Linux was released in 1991, and by the mid-1990s, it had gained popularity as a server operating system, hosting many Web 1.0 websites.</p>

        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>Linux was primarily used to run web servers and host websites, often paired with technologies like Apache (web server software), MySQL databases, and scripting languages like PHP and Perl.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <p>Many early Web 1.0 sites were hosted on Linux servers, using Apache to serve web pages and PHP to dynamically generate content from a database.</p>

        <h2>3.6 Early Search Engines</h2>
        <h3>Who</h3>
        <p>Early search engines were developed by academic researchers and companies to help users navigate the growing web. Notable examples include Archie (1990), Lycos (1994), AltaVista (1995), Yahoo! (1995), and HotBot (1996).</p>

        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>These search engines indexed web content and allowed users to search for relevant information using keyword queries, helping users find specific content among the expanding web.</p>

        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>As the web grew, users needed a way to find information efficiently. Search engines provided searchable indexes of web pages, helping users locate content more quickly.</p>

        <h3>When</h3>
        <p>The first search engine, Archie, appeared in 1990. By the mid-1990s, search engines like Lycos, AltaVista, Yahoo!, and HotBot became widely popular tools for navigating Web 1.0.</p>

        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>Early search engines crawled and indexed web pages, ranking them based on relevance, keyword density, and backlinks. Some, like Yahoo!, functioned as directories curated by human editors, while others, like AltaVista, used automated algorithms.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <h4>What Happened to Them?</h4>
            <p><strong>Archie:</strong> The first search engine for locating FTP sites. It became obsolete as the web grew. <strong>Failed.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Lycos:</strong> Initially successful, but struggled to compete with later search engines like Google. <strong>Failed in search, survives in other areas.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>AltaVista:</strong> Once popular, it was acquired by Yahoo! and shut down in 2013. <strong>Failed.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Yahoo!:</strong> A major player early on, but eventually lost ground to Google. <strong>Partially succeeded.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>HotBot:</strong> Known for speed, but lost relevance with Google's rise. <strong>Failed.</strong></p>
