            <h2>2.1 ARPANET</h2>
            <h3>Who</h3>
            <p>ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was developed by the U.S. Department of Defense and is considered the precursor to the modern internet.</p>

            <h3>What</h3>
            <p>ARPANET was the first packet-switching network, allowing computers at different research institutions to communicate. This network laid the foundation for the internet.</p>

            <h3>Why</h3>
            <p>Its primary goal was to create a communication system that could survive disruptions and ensure resilience in case of an attack.</p>
