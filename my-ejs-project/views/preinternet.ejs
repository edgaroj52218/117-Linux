        <!-- Section 1: JC Licklider -->
        <section class="content">
            <h2>1.1 JC Licklider</h2>
            <h3>Who</h3>
            <p>Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider, commonly known as JC Licklider, was an American psychologist and computer scientist.</p>

            <h3>What</h3>
            <p>Licklider was a pioneer in computer science and conceptualized the "Intergalactic Computer Network," which laid the foundation for modern internet ideas.</p>

            <h3>Why</h3>
            <p>He envisioned computers enhancing human communication and collaboration. His ideas eventually shaped the creation of ARPANET, the precursor to the internet.</p>

            <h3>When</h3>
            <p>In the early 1960s, while at ARPA, Lickliderâ€™s work significantly influenced networked computing and time-sharing systems.</p>

            <div class="example">
                <h4>Example:</h4>
                <p>Read Licklider's influential paper, "<a href="https://worrydream.com/refs/Licklider_1960_-_Man-Computer_Symbiosis.pdf" target="_blank">Man-Computer Symbiosis</a>," where he envisions human-computer interaction for collaborative work.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 2: Nuclear Weapons -->
        <section class="content">
            <h2>1.2 Nuclear Weapons</h2>
            <h3>Who</h3>
            <p>During the Cold War, the U.S. and Soviet Union developed nuclear arsenals, influencing the need for secure communication.</p>

            <h3>What</h3>
            <p>The presence and threat of nuclear weapons led to a push for a resilient, decentralized communication system to withstand nuclear attacks.</p>

            <h3>Why</h3>
            <p>Maintaining communication and command control during nuclear strikes was essential, spurring innovation in network resilience.</p>

            <div class="example">
                <h4>Example:</h4>
                <p>Read about the impact of packet-switching technology on modern networks in "<a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet" target="_blank">A Brief History of the Internet</a>" by the Internet Society.</p>
